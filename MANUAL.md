# Using FediBooks

## The User Interface (UI)
FediBooks provides a robust, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to aid the user in creating and maintaining their bot(s). No knowledge of the command line is required to use FediBooks, although there are some optional features that make use of it. This section of the manual will explain the UI in greater detail.

### Bot Creation Wizard
The Bot Creation Wizard guides you through the process of creating a new bot.

#### Choose an Instance
The first step (after the welcome page) is choosing an instance for the bot to run on. This doesn't need to be the same instance as your account(s)! Any instance should be fine. I reccomend [botsin.space](https://botsin.space/about), a Mastodon instance dedicated to running bots.
