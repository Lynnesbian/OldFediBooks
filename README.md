FediBooks
==========

A Python-based multiplatform fediverse bot creator and manager with an intuitive Qt-based GUI. It's **not ready or usable yet**, but it will be eventually.

## Installing (WIP)
Python 3 is necessary. FediBooks (and some of its dependencies) will not work with Python 2.
```
git clone https://github.com/Lynnesbian/FediBooks
cd FediBooks
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./main.py
```
